1. A
COMPARISON
OF THE PARLIAmentary
Protestation with
the late Canonicall Oath, and
the difference betwixt them.

    _ Reall differencies betwixt the Protestation of the Parliament,
and the Oath of the Canon: first in the
matter of them both, the Doctrine established.

    _ An Advertisement touching the wine which in some places
is allowed to the Laity after the taking of the bread.

    _ Of that wherin the Oath of the sixt Canon and the
Protestation do differ, in respect of the matter contained
in either, which the other hath not.

    _ The difference in forme betwixt the Parliamentary Protestation
and the Canonicall Oath may induce us to
the one, and with-hold us from the other.

    _ Personall considerations, which may induce to the making
of the Protestation, and discouragement from
taking of the Oath.

    _ An Answer to your doubt of the •ase of Conscience,
wherin the opposition betwixt your Seminary and me is
clearly demonstrated.

    _ My words which you take for the ground of your
doubt cleared of ambiguity, and the truth declare•,
how Christ may be said to be received with one kind,
how with both.

    _ Though the faithfull receive whole Christ with on•
part of the Sacrament, yet it is utterly •nlawfull, either
to administer the Sacrament in the Popish Church
with 〈◊〉 kind•, or so to receive it, though none other
exception were to be taken at the Religion then
their broken communion, with the inducements to it,
and consequences upon it.

    _ The third p•rticul•• of scandall answered.
